47. The balance remains zero if a negative number is inserted and

48. The program will allow zero to be inserted. Prediction is true. No error

50. A boolean controlled if the circle was visible or not, this is well suited to be as such because 
    it can only be visible or not. 

51. The price is added to the total so that only the required amount for one ticket is added. 
    The price is removed from the balance so that only the required amount for one ticket is removed.

52. It is possible to remove it but now the user does not know if the machine needs more money to 
    be inserted. Nothing happens if no money is inserted.

53. No because a ticket will not print unless the required amount is there in the first place.

55. `saving = price * discount;`

56. `mean = total / count;`
